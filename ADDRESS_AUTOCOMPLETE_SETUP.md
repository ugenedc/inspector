# Address Autocomplete Setup Guide

## 🚀 Your address autocomplete is ready to use!

I've implemented a powerful address autocomplete feature using LocationIQ's free API service. Here's what you need to do to activate it:

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### **AddressAutocomplete Component**
- **File**: `src/components/forms/AddressAutocomplete.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - ⚡ Real-time address suggestions as you type
  - 🌍 Worldwide address coverage (US, CA, GB, AU supported)
  - ⌨️ Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
  - 📱 Mobile-friendly responsive design
  - 🎯 Smart debouncing (300ms delay) to optimize API calls
  - 🔍 Icon-based suggestion types (buildings, roads, places)
  - ♿ Accessible with proper ARIA support

### **Integration with Inspection Form**
- **File**: `src/components/inspections/InspectionForm.tsx`
- ✅ Replaced manual address textarea with smart autocomplete
- ✅ Maintains all existing form validation and functionality

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Your API Key to Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```bash
# LocationIQ API Key for Address Autocomplete
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY=pk.13a9cb23c8e5d8f1b9053004dbbf05e2

# Your existing Supabase and OpenAI variables...
```

### 2. Restart Your Development Server

After adding the environment variable, restart your Next.js dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **User Experience**
1. **User starts typing** an address (minimum 3 characters)
2. **Live suggestions appear** in a dropdown with icons
3. **User can navigate** with arrow keys or mouse
4. **Selection fills** the complete address automatically
5. **Smart formatting** provides full address details
